              The Fault in Our Stars showcases Hazel’s point of view; her story
              is very witty and funny. We admire Hazel and Augustus’s acceptance
              of the disease that has taken over their lives. Neither of them is
              self-pitying nor impractically content with what must be a highly
              traumatic experience.

              extremely mature, forced to confront the idea of death at a young
              age, so moments together when they can just be teenagers are so
              special. It would be fantastic to see characters like these in
              real life.

              These two teenagers genuinely care about each other and, for lack
              of a better description, have a lot of fun together. There aren’t
              many significant romantic expressions or silly things in this
              book, and hanging out and playing video games is just as good a
              pastime for them as any other. The story reveals the intricacies
              of each character and shares their personalities outside of their
              illnesses, which are commonly used to define them.

              The Fault in Our Stars is an emotionally charged story that will
              stay with you for a long time. John Green’s simple, everyday
              English makes this an easy read for teenagers and

            </p>
            <p class="blank-line">
              The characters are well-developed, each with their storyline,
              traits, and quirks. The author’s superb description ensures that
              readers can feel the emotions of every character. The
              characterization is so good that of the main characters and those
              in supporting roles, such as Hazel’s mother, Dr. Maria, and Isaac.
              They seamlessly blend into the plot. They provide all the
              assistance Hazel and Augustus require to cope with their
              condition. Their understanding and character development are worth
              reading.
            </p>
            <p class="blank-line">
              Another important takeaway from the book is how Green has subtly
              incorporated essential life lessons into the plot. The sharp and
              impactful open dialogues are the icing on the cake.

            <p class="blank-line">Thoughts about the book</p>
            <p class="blank-line">
              Overall, The Fault in Our Stars is a brilliantly written work of
              literature that uses warmth, humor, and rationalism to address a
              sensitive subject. Part of a writer’s brilliance is making the
              reader feel as if they’ve gotten to know their characters so well
              that they care about them and are upset if something terrible
              happens. It is one of those rare books that will move you into
              tears.
            </p>
            <p class="blank-line">
              We rarely read sad stories because we need happy endings to keep
              our spirits up. Still, you can enjoy reading stories like this for
              their depth and significance. While it isn’t a happy story, and it
              makes you gloomy occasionally, it also makes you laugh and
              inspires you, so you don’t end up feeling downright depressed. Its
              philosophical nature also pushes your intellectual limits.
